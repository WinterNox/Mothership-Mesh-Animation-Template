# Mothership-Mesh-Animation-Template

This repository contains a [PewPew Live](https://pewpew.live/) level showcasing a recreated versions of the mesh animations of a mothership and a super mothership with three sides. The code of the mesh animations has been written keeping customization in mind. Hence, it can be used as a template for the animation of a mothership or super mothership with any number of sides (`n >= 3`) with just a few simple tweaks to the code. 

As of now, it only supports mono-colored meshes, as all the motherships and super motherships in the game are mono-colored.

To better understand the code, you can watch the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/neLkT-NY8FM) for this implementation on my YouTube channel.
